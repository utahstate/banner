# and placed in one of the following locations:
#   1. A directory referenced by a JVM argument (-D). For the Advising module, the argument is BANNER_ADVISOR_UI_CONFIG. For the Student module, the argument is BANNER_STUDENT_UI_CONFIG.
#   2. In the classpath, such as in WEB_INF/classes.
#   3. An exported shell variable. For the Advising module, the argument is BANNER_ADVISOR_UI_CONFIG. For the Student module, the argument is BANNER_STUDENT_UI_CONFIG.

# _________________Additional Links______________________________________________
#
# This section is used to configure Additional Links for both students and advisors.
# To disable the display of an individual element, please place a # at the start of that individual element's .view line.
# Each additional link includes the following information, each as part of their own property:
#     roles = The roles that will be able to see the link on the page.
#     description = This is what the link will be called in the user interface. Use this or
#     descriptioncode = This is what the link will be called in the user interface, but it will be a code that is found
#         in messages.properties
#     url = This is the URL. It can make use of the following special parameters, as well as any other parameter found
#           in the application configuration file or banner_configuration.groovy:
#         id - The id of the person logged in.
#         studentId - The id of the person the page is being rendered for.
#         role - The role of the person logged in.
#         profileTerm - The term the profile page is loaded for.
# It important to note that if you are using a URL with an =, you need to escape the = with a \, so \=
#
# Each additional link is given a sequence number. The system will start at 0 and process the links until it encounters a
# sequence number which does not have a property. If you comment out a section be sure to adjust the sequence numbers
# so they are consecutive. Do not skip a number and the first sequence must start with 0.
#
# For MEP institutions, the additional links section does not support an all institution. If you are making use of MEP,
# then you will need a set of links for each institution. Each set of links will start at sequence number 0.
#
# _________________Degree Evaluation______________________________________________
# The Degree Evaluation link can be turned on or off here. Unlike the other links in the additional links section, the Degree
# Evaluation link URL is not configurable.  The Degree Evaluation URL will be determined depending on if your
# institution is using CAPP or Degree Works per the GTVSDAX setting for the Internal Code = PREREQCHK.
# If your institution is using Degree Works, refer to the Integration with Ellucian Degree Works in the
# Banner Student Self-Service Installation Guide to configure the URL.
# The description of the link can only be changed by modifying the messages.properties file.
# Degree Evaluation is always displayed prior to the more configurable additional links.

# _________________Banner 8.x Link______________________________________________
# These links are designed to link directly into Banner 8. They make use of the banner8.SS.url, which is configured in
# either the application's configuration file, or the banner_configuration.groovy file. All of the link descriptions are
# taken from messages.properties and are localized. Notice that many of the links are duplicated for advisors and students.
# They make use of the same description but have different roles and URLs.
#<institution>.navigation.additionallinks.xx.roles=Advisor, AdvisorOverride, FacultyAdvisor, Student, Faculty, FacultyOverride
# Banner 8 links should include the additional line:
#<institution>.navigation.additionallinks.xx.type=Banner8
